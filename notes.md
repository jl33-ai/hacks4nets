## Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)

**Summary**:
- FGSM is a quick and straightforward method to create adversarial examples, which perturbs the input data by a small amount in the direction of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input.

**Low-Level Details**:
- It calculates the gradients once and then creates the adversarial example by adding a small vector (whose elements are the sign of the gradient elements) to the original input.

**Differences from Other Attacks**:
- Unlike iterative methods, FGSM takes a single step, making it less effective but much faster compared to methods like the CW attack.

**Sources**:
- [Original Paper: "Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572)

## Basic Iterative Method (BIM)

**Summary**:
- An extension of FGSM, the BIM applies the gradient sign method iteratively with a small step size and clips the pixel values of intermediate results to ensure they are within an \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood of the original image.

**Low-Level Details**:
- It is more powerful than FGSM as it iteratively refines the adversarial example.

**Differences from Other Attacks**:
- It often results in more effective adversarial examples compared to FGSM due to its iterative nature.

**Sources**:
- [Original Paper: "Adversarial Examples in the Physical World"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02533)

## Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)

**Summary**:
- PGD is considered one of the strongest first-order adversaries, often used as a benchmark for model robustness.

**Low-Level Details**:
- Similar to BIM but starts from a random point within the allowed perturbation range and performs a projective step to ensure that the perturbations stay within a specified limit after each iteration.

**Differences from Other Attacks**:
- It is often more effective than BIM due to the random start, which helps in escaping poor local maxima.

**Sources**:
- [Original Paper: "Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial Attacks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06083)

## DeepFool

**Summary**:
- DeepFool is an attack designed to be as efficient as possible in finding the minimum perturbation needed to misclassify an input.

**Low-Level Details**:
- It uses a linear approximation of the model's decision boundary to find the shortest path to misclassification.

**Differences from Other Attacks**:
- The perturbations generated are typically smaller than those from FGSM and PGD, often making them harder to detect.

**Sources**:
- [Original Paper: "DeepFool: a simple and accurate method to fool deep neural networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04599)

## Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA)

**Summary**:
- JSMA focuses on perturbing a small fraction of the input features that are most influential to the output.

**Low-Level Details**:
- It computes a saliency map using the Jacobian of the model's output with respect to the input, and then alters the most significant features.

**Differences from Other Attacks**:
- It is a targeted attack and usually changes very few pixels, but those changes can be more noticeable.

**Sources**:
- [Original Paper: "The Limitations of Deep Learning in Adversarial Settings"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07528)

## Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP)

**Summary**:
- UAPs are perturbations that can be added to any input in the dataset to cause misclassification.

**Low-Level Details**:
- They are found by taking into account the cumulative distribution of the perturbations over the entire data distribution.

**Differences from Other Attacks**:
- UAPs demonstrate that it is possible to create highly transferable adversarial examples across different inputs.

**Sources**:
- [Original Paper: "Universal adversarial perturbations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08401)

These attacks illustrate a range of strategies that adversaries might employ, from fast and simple perturbations to complex, iterative, and universal approaches. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and they collectively demonstrate the challenges in securing neural networks against adversarial threats.



# SUMMARY

- The Carlini & Wagner (CW) attack is a sophisticated optimization-based adversarial technique designed to fool neural network classifiers. 
- It formulates the attack as an optimization problem to find the smallest change to the input data that will change the classifier's decision, often using the \( L_2 \) or \( L_{\infty} \) norms to measure the perturbation size. 
- The CW attack is particularly notable for its effectiveness against models that are robust to other types of attacks, such as the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM).

# LOW LEVEL DETAILS

- The CW attack optimizes the perturbation by adjusting the input based on the gradient of the loss concerning the input. This is typically done in an iterative manner until a successful adversarial example is found or a specified criterion is met.
- A key part of the CW attack is the use of a modified loss function, which includes a term that encourages the model to misclassify the perturbed input and a regularization term that keeps the perturbation size small.
- The optimization can be subject to different constraints to ensure the perturbed input remains valid within the data domain (e.g., pixel values must stay in the [0, 255] range for images).
- The CW attack also employs a search over the regularization parameter to find the smallest perturbation that causes misclassification. This search is typically done using a binary search algorithm.

# DIFFERENCES FROM FGSM

- **Approach**: The FGSM is a one-step attack method that generates adversarial examples by adding noise in the direction of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input. In contrast, the CW attack is an iterative method that carefully optimizes the perturbation to minimize its size while ensuring misclassification.
- **Complexity**: FGSM is simpler and faster since it involves just one step, while the CW attack is more complex and computationally intensive due to its iterative nature.
- **Perturbation Size**: The CW attack specifically aims to minimize the size of the perturbation, making it potentially less detectable than the perturbations generated by FGSM.
- **Effectiveness**: The CW attack is generally more effective at creating adversarial examples that are misclassified by the network, particularly against defenses that can withstand FGSM attacks.
- **Targeted vs. Untargeted**: FGSM can be used for both targeted and untargeted attacks, but it is commonly used in an untargeted fashion. The CW attack is often used as a targeted attack, aiming to misclassify an input as a specific incorrect class.

In the context of creating adversarial examples for attacking neural networks, besides first-order methods that primarily rely on gradients, there are several other approaches. These can be broadly categorized into:

1. **Zeroth-Order Methods**:
   - **Gradient-Free Attacks**: These methods do not require access to the gradients of the model. They are useful against models where gradient access is not possible (e.g., black-box models).
   - **Example Techniques**: Optimization algorithms like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or other search-based techniques that iteratively modify the input based on the output feedback.

2. **Higher-Order Methods**:
   - **Second-Order Attacks**: These involve using the second-order derivatives (Hessian matrix) of the loss function. They can be more precise than first-order methods but are also more computationally expensive.
   - **Example Techniques**: Newton's method or trust-region methods that consider the curvature of the loss landscape for creating adversarial examples.

3. **Transfer Attacks**:
   - **Pre-Trained Model Attacks**: Here, adversarial examples are generated using a different model (which could be a white-box model) and then applied to the target model. The principle behind this is that adversarial examples often transfer between different models.
   - **Example Techniques**: Creating adversarial examples on a surrogate model where gradients are accessible, then applying these examples to attack the target model.

4. **Decision-Based Attacks**:
   - **Boundary Attacks**: These methods only require access to the final decision or output of the model and do not need gradient information. They iteratively modify the input to search for the decision boundary of the classifier.
   - **Example Techniques**: Methods that start with an adversarial example and then reduce the perturbation while staying adversarial.

5. **Score-Based Attacks**:
   - **Confidence Attacks**: These attacks use the confidence scores of the model's output (like softmax probabilities) to guide the search for adversarial examples, without needing explicit gradient information.
   - **Example Techniques**: Techniques that iteratively adjust the input to maximize the confidence in an incorrect class.

6. **Physical Attacks**:
   - **Real-World Attacks**: These attacks involve modifying physical objects in the real world to fool classifiers, rather than directly manipulating digital inputs.
   - **Example Techniques**: Altering road signs to fool autonomous driving systems, or wearing specially designed clothing to evade surveillance systems.

Each of these methods has its own advantages and use cases, and the choice of technique can depend on the attacker's knowledge about the model (like whether it's a black-box or white-box scenario), the computational resources available, and the specific goals of the attack (like stealthiness or effectiveness). Understanding and defending against a wide range of attack methods is crucial for enhancing the robustness of machine learning systems.



Why do these matter? 
Self driving cars, stickers on stop signs
Security critical use cases for Deep Learning 


They highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in AI models that have far-reaching implications for security, safety, trust, ethics, legal compliance, and economic stability. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the safe and responsible deployment of AI technologies in society.

Certainly. Adversarial attacks on neural networks can lead to serious, even life-threatening situations, especially when these networks are used in critical systems. Here are some hypothetical worst-case scenarios illustrating the potential dangers:

1. **Autonomous Vehicles and Traffic Signs**:
   - An adversarial sticker or graffiti on a stop sign could cause an autonomous vehicle's recognition system to misclassify it as a yield sign or something else. This misclassification might lead the vehicle to not stop at the intersection, potentially causing a serious accident.

2. **Medical Diagnosis Systems**:
   - In a healthcare setting, if an adversarial attack subtly alters medical images (like MRI or CT scans), an AI-based diagnostic tool might misdiagnose a serious condition like a tumor as benign or vice versa. This could lead to incorrect treatment, potentially endangering the patient's life.

3. **Financial Fraud Detection Systems**:
   - Adversarial manipulation of transaction data could bypass AI-based fraud detection systems in financial institutions, allowing large-scale fraudulent transactions to go undetected. This could result in substantial financial losses.

4. **Facial Recognition and Security Systems**:
   - Adversarial attacks could be used to fool facial recognition systems at airports or in surveillance systems. For example, a carefully designed makeup pattern or facial accessory might enable a person to evade detection or impersonate someone else, leading to security breaches.

5. **Military and Defense Applications**:
   - In military applications, adversarial attacks could alter the output of AI systems used for target recognition in automated weaponry, potentially resulting in misidentification of targets and unintended casualties.

6. **AI-Based Filtering Systems**:
   - Adversarial content could bypass AI-driven content moderation systems on social platforms, allowing harmful or illegal content, such as deepfake videos or hate speech, to spread unchecked.

7. **Voice Recognition Systems**:
   - Specially crafted adversarial audio samples could trick voice-activated systems into executing harmful commands, like unlocking doors or accessing confidential information, without the knowledge of the user.

8. **Stock Trading Algorithms**:
   - In the finance sector, adversarial attacks on AI-driven trading algorithms could cause erratic market behavior or unfair advantages, leading to significant economic disruptions or losses.

These hypothetical scenarios illustrate the potential severity of adversarial attacks on AI systems. They underscore the need for rigorous testing and the development of robust, adversarial-resistant models, especially in high-stakes domains.

Genetic algorithms. 
DE:

Differential Evolution (DE) is a type of evolutionary algorithm and a method of optimization that belongs to the general category of genetic algorithms. It is particularly effective for optimization problems involving continuous parameter spaces and is known for its simplicity, reliability, and robustness. Differential Evolution is widely used in various fields, such as engineering, economics, chemistry, and physics, for solving complex optimization problems.

### How Differential Evolution Works:

Differential Evolution iterates through a simple cycle of stages to evolve a population of candidate solutions towards an optimal solution. The basic steps are as follows:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - A population of candidate solutions is randomly generated. Each candidate, often referred to as an "agent" or "vector," is a potential solution to the optimization problem.

2. **Mutation**:
   - For each agent in the population, a mutant vector is generated. This is typically done by selecting three distinct agents from the population at random and combining them. A common strategy is to add the weighted difference between two of these agents to the third one.

3. **Crossover (Recombination)**:
   - The mutant vector is then mixed with the original agent to create a "trial vector". This mixing is often done by randomly choosing which genes to take from either the mutant or the original agent, based on a crossover probability.

4. **Selection**:
   - The trial vector competes against the original agent. The one that yields a better score according to the objective function of the problem is retained for the next generation.

5. **Iteration**:
   - These steps are repeated over multiple generations until a stopping criterion is met (like a maximum number of iterations or a satisfactory fitness level).

### Key Features:

- **Simple and Few Parameters**: DE is characterized by simplicity and has relatively few control parameters, which typically include the population size, crossover probability, and differential weight.
- **Global Optimization**: It is well-suited for global optimization problems, as the mechanism of DE helps in exploring the solution space thoroughly.
- **Handling Noisy and Time-Varying Problems**: DE is robust in handling noisy and time-varying optimization problems.
- **No Gradient Information Needed**: Unlike methods like gradient descent, DE does not require gradient information, making it suitable for non-differentiable or complex objective functions.

### Applications:

Differential Evolution is used in a wide range of applications, from optimizing complex engineering designs to solving problems in machine learning, like hyperparameter tuning of algorithms.

Its effectiveness, ease of implementation, and ability to handle complex, nonlinear, and multimodal functions make it a popular choice for optimization problems in various scientific and engineering disciplines.
